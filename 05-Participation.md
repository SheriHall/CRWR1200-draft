# Activities and Engagement

Do all of the creative activities listed on the [course website](https://crwr1200.netlify.com/category/activities/). Do one activity each week for nine weeks. Instructions are included for each activity. If you get stuck, ask for help (see the document entitled [Asking for Help Online](06-Asking-for-Help-Online.md)).

The creative exercises are designed to help you broaden your creativity, exercise your imagination, and have some fun along the way. The short narratives, words, images, sounds, and so on that are associated with the creative activities are intended to provide possible material to use in your composition. But your composition does not have to include all the things you write down while doing your creative exercises. Just choose a few things and integrate them. For example, if you write about a bird in a creative exercise, you might use the image of a bird in your composition. You can transfer the images, words, or whatever directly into your composition, weaving them into the text, or you can adapt and apply them in different ways. It's up to you. The exercises provide textual fuel for the composition. 

As you do the creative exercises, write down the short narratives of the exercises (as well as notes about them) and include these in your [Exercises document](Exercises.md)).

Then, after you have completed nine weeks of creative exercises, writing, and readings, you will have two weeks to complete your draft composition. You may use these two weeks to work on your own or in consultation with your instructor (using the communication methods outlined in the section on [asking for help ](06-Asking-for-Help-Online.md).

This is an online class, which makes your willingness to engage creatively
with the learning process all the more important. Because developing a style of authentic creative inquiry is very much a process of blending your own personal awareness with skills and practical techniques, your own emotional involvement in the class is as important as your academic knowledge of the material.

It's easy to identify those who possess exemplary interpersonal and creative
skills. They are relaxed, open, responsive, and kind. Often they exhibit skills
that we tend to assign to the social sphere: personal warmth, consideration of
others, hesitancy to judge, sensitivity to emotions. In our class we focus on
these interpersonal factors as a foundation for our experiences with one
another. And we itemize them as features along the continuum of self-awareness:

* Commitment to the development of self-awareness.
* Openness to interpersonal process.
* Ability to participate in appropriate self-disclosure.
* Consideration of and responsiveness to others.
* Commitment to enhancing the interpersonal experience of everyone in the class.
* Willingness to examine personal values, beliefs, and judgments.
* Ability to take personal responsibility for learning.
* Willingness to deal with conflicts appropriately if and when they arise.
* Ability to be open and responsive to appropriate feedback.

Each item on the above list is an aspect of the first item:
self-awareness. The most foundational skill in creativity is
self-awareness. Those who develop this skill consistently query their
own responses, thoughts, and feelings. They ask themselves:

* What am I feeling right now?
* What am I thinking right now?
* Why am I reacting in this particular way?
* What do my thoughts, feelings, and reactions tell me about myself?
* Is there anything about my current behavior that suggests unresolved themes in my life?
* Is my perception of myself consistent with what other people tell me about the kind of person I am?
* When and how do I get stuck, and what am I doing to work on this?
* In what ways do I get overwhelmed, or shut down, or avoid?

These questions, and many others, require the capacity for self-reflection and
self-awareness. As we continue in the course, you may wish to consider these
questions as they apply to you.
